# Getting Started â€“ dsbuntis

There are multiple ways to use `dsbuntis`: The older function-based API and the
newer `Session` API.

## The simple, old, function-based API

From the initial API only one function has stayed around: If you just want to
get your substitutions, `getAllSubs` is where you should look.
